            I started RockstarMath 10 years ago with a simple but powerful idea: give students of
            all ages the easiest to follow and most understandable math courses imaginable. After
            attending too many college and graduate math classes that left me dazed and confused by
            unexplained theorems and missing steps, I knew there had to be a better way.
